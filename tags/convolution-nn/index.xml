      <description>In my article about object detection approaches, I mentioned a few ways to handle object detection and introduced YOLO NN model which uses a single Neural Network to simultaneously localize as well as classify the objects. It uses a regression approach to detect the object by dividing the image into a grid. To me, it seems really simple but innovative approach and I wanted to try it out myself. So I decided to rewrite my live gender classifier to use only one NN to detect as well as classify faces in one single go.</description>
