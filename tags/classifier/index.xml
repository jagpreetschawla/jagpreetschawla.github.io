      <description>In my article Gender Classification, I explained how I trained a basic a NN to classify faces based on gender using TensorFlow. In this article, we will look at how to take the trained model, and convert it into a program which classifies all faces on a live camera feed. To introduce tensorflow-serving, we will set up a tensorflow-serving server to serve our NN model. Our program will then use this server for classification.</description>

      <description>TensorFlow provides an amazing framework to quickly set up, train and deploy a Machine Learning model. In this article, we will look at all its awesomeness as I go through one of my basic projects which uses TensorFlow to classify a face as a male or female. Later, I used the trained model to create a deployable system and used it to classify faces on a live camera feed. You can read more about it here.</description>
