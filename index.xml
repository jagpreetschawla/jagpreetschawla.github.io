        <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Jagpreet Singh Chawla, and this is my blog. With the recent developments in the field of CS, there are a lot of interesting things to learn and projects to work on. Although all necessary resources are easily available, they are scattered and finding and combining them is time-consuming. This is my attempt to help others by sharing my hard-earned knowledge and experience in a simple and intuitive method as I work on different projects.</description>

        <description>TensorFlow provides an amazing framework to quickly set up, train and deploy a Machine Learning model. In this article, we will look at all its awesomeness as I go through one of my basic projects which uses TensorFlow to classify a face as a male or female. Later, I used the trained model to create a deployable system and used it to classify faces on a live camera feed. I will be posting an article about it soon.</description>
