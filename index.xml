        <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Jagpreet Singh Chawla, and this is my blog. With the recent developments in the field of CS, there are a lot of interesting things to learn and projects to work on. Although all necessary resources are easily available, they are scattered and finding and combining them is time-consuming. This is my attempt to help others by sharing my hard-earned knowledge and experience in a simple and intuitive method as I work on different projects.</description>
